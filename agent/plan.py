"""Assignment 2, Parts A and C: the planner and the reviser. This file is yours.

The contract (checks/FORMATS.md, section 10). The checker calls both functions
directly, with a scripted model that keeps a copy of every request, so keep these
exact signatures. You may add keyword arguments with defaults; the checker passes
only these.

    make_plan(client, issue_number, tool_schemas, trace=None) -> dict
    revise_plan(client, plan, step_results, trace=None) -> dict

    client        harness.client.ModelClient: client.create(system=, messages=, tools=)
    issue_number  the issue to triage, an int
    tool_schemas  the tool definitions, as ctx.tools.schemas gives them
    plan          the active plan, its steps' statuses brought up to date
    step_results  one entry per step that has run (section 10.3)
    trace         a harness.trace.TraceWriter, or None. When you get one, trace your
                  model call: trace.model_call(0, response, purpose="plan") in
                  make_plan, purpose="revise" in revise_plan
    returns       a plan (section 10.1): {"meta": {...}, "steps": [...]}

make_plan writes the plan and stops (Lecture 2, slide 15). Its request carries the
task, the issue number and the tool list, and nothing from the issue: not its body,
not its title. The checker looks for each issue's sentinel string in every request.
The usual way to get the plan back as data: offer the model one tool whose
input_schema is agent/plan_schema.json, and read the plan from its call. Mark an
argument that waits on an earlier step's result "$fill"; the executor fills it in.

revise_plan repairs before it replaces: it never changes a step whose status is
done; it may change a step that failed, to retry it, and any step not yet run. A
step whose step result says "done" comes back unchanged, every field but status,
whatever the model wrote. Its request carries structured step results only (status, counts, paths,
error codes): never the issue's text, and never a step result's `args`, which the
executor may have filled in from the issue.

Keep your prompts in prompts/.
