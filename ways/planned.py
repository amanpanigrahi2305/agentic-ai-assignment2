"""Way 5, planned: RepoMind with a plan it cannot quietly abandon. This file is yours.

Assignment 2, Parts B, C and D. Like every way, run(ctx) -> None (see ways/__init__.py):

    python run.py --way planned --set dev
    python run.py --way planned --critique self --set dev      # or external; off is the default

The run, in order (checks/FORMATS.md, section 10):

  1. Plan: agent.plan.make_plan(ctx.client, ctx.issue_number, ctx.tools.schemas,
     trace=ctx.trace). The planner never sees the issue.
  2. Check, then validate. First the plan against agent/plan_schema.json, with
     harness.schema.errors (a vendor may accept "strict" and not enforce it), and
     that its last step is post_comment (a plan without one passes the four checks
     and posts nothing); a plan that breaks either writes
     ctx.trace.event("schema", errors=...). Then agent.validator.validate(plan). A
     plan that fails any of these is rejected and re-planned, at most MAX_REPLANS
     times; then the run escalates: ctx.trace.end("escalated", detail), no tool
     call, nothing posted.
  3. Log: ctx.trace.plan(1, plan), before the first tool call.
  4. Execute the steps in order, each tool call through ctx.call_tool, naming the
     plan step it runs for: ctx.call_tool(n, tool, args, plan_step=step["id"]). Where a step
     has arguments marked "$fill", one model call fills them in: offer it that
     step's tool alone, and trace it with ctx.trace.model_call(n,
     response, purpose="execute"). Act on the tool calls a response holds,
     whatever its stop_reason says. The executor may run, retry or halt a step; it
     may not add, drop or reorder one. A call that is not the current step's tool
     never runs: refuse it and write ctx.trace.event("off_plan", step=..., tool=...).
  5. Part C: revise only at one checkpoint, after a search step: the first search
     step, and any search step a revision added or changed, until MAX_REVISIONS is
     spent; and only when the check there fails (a check in code, not in a prompt,
     such as "the search returned at least one source file, not only documentation
     or translations"): revise_plan, which never changes a step that is done but may
     change a failed one to retry it, then check the new version against the schema
     and validate it, write
     ctx.trace.event("revision", checkpoint=..., version=..., valid=...), and log a
     valid one with ctx.trace.plan(version, plan). A revision that fails the
     validator never runs, and counts against the bound.
  6. Part D: before post_comment, the second pass, in the mode ctx.critique names
     (off, self or external), at most MAX_ROUNDS rounds. A round checks the
     current draft (agent.critique.verify, or agent.critique.self_critique) and
     writes ctx.trace.event("critique", round=..., mode=..., result="pass" or
     "fail", reason=..., changed=..., draft=...). A draft that fails, with a round
     left, is rewritten by one model call given the reason, traced with
     purpose="critique", and the next round checks the new draft. A draft still
     failing in the last round is held: not posted, and the run ends escalated.
     Nothing is posted until the last round, and a run posts one comment at most.

The comment is Assignment 1's: two lines, label: and file: (section 1). A run that
finishes its plan can leave its ending to the runner, which writes completed.

Part G's ways/notes.py extends this way without changing it, so build this one with
hooks it can override: for example an executor class whose methods run after every
step, build what each model call sees, and run before the comment.

The checker reads MAX_REPLANS, MAX_REVISIONS and MAX_ROUNDS from this module, and
runs this way against scripted models (harness/scripted.py). You can run them too,
free:

    python run.py --way planned --backend harness.scripted:AlwaysInvalidPlanner --set dev
    python run.py --way planned --backend harness.scripted:OffPlanExecutor --set dev
    python run.py --way planned --critique external --backend harness.scripted:DraftNamesUnseenFile --set dev
