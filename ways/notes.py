"""Way 6, notes: the planned way with a progress file and a compaction. This file is yours.

Assignment 2, Part G. Your planned way with the second pass off, plus two things,
so that Part F's configurations stay as they were (checks/FORMATS.md, section 10):

    python run.py --way notes --notes off --issues 4203,4204,4206 --runs 2
    python run.py --way notes --notes on --issues 4203,4204,4206 --runs 2

  1. A progress file, ctx.progress_path (runs/<run_id>.progress.json): JSON outside
     the conversation, written after every step, holding at least
       "steps_done"  the ids of the steps that have run, in order
       "paths"       every path a search returned or a read read, in order
     and never a search term: terms come from the issue's text. Say in the file what
     it records (an "about" line, or labelled keys): a bare list of paths can be read
     as a to-do list. With ctx.notes == "on", every executor call and the questions'
     call after its first write show the model the file's text, exactly as written
     (not the planner, not the reviser). With "off", it is still written, and never
     shown.
  2. A history and a compaction: every model call sees the run's history so far,
     its step results oldest first. Once that history passes COMPACT_AT tokens, the
     oldest entries become a model-written summary and the recent ones stay as
     they were. Write ctx.trace.event("compaction", threshold=COMPACT_AT, tokens=...)
     each time. It runs whatever ctx.notes says. A low threshold is a test setting
     here, not advice.

Then, at the end of the run, however it ended (comment posted, escalated, halted),
one model call asks six closed questions, each "Has this run seen `<path>`: did a
search return it, or did you read it?", and returns six answers, yes or no: about
the three earliest paths the run saw (its tool_call lines returned them; all of
them, if it saw fewer), and paths it did not see for the rest. If the run has not
compacted yet, compact its history once first. Write each answer as
ctx.trace.event("question", path=..., answer=...), the six together.

Part G's 12 runs are the ones on issues 4203, 4204 and 4206; a notes run on a
development issue is development, and reports/LAB_02.json's context leaves it out.
